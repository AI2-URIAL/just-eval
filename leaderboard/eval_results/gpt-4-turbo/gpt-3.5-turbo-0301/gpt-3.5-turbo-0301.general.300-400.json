Create a new branch: Before you start resolving the conflict, create a new branch to work on. This will ensure that you don't accidentally make changes to the wrong branch.\n\n3. Pull the changes: Pull the changes from the branch that you want to merge into your new branch. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal: `git pull origin branch-name`.\n\n4. Resolve the conflict: Open the file that has a conflict and look for the conflict markers. These markers will show you where the conflict is and what changes are causing it. You will need to manually edit the file to resolve the conflict. Once you have made the necessary changes, save the file.\n\n5. Add and commit the changes: After you have resolved the conflict, add the changes to your new branch by running the following command: `git add file-name`. Then, commit the changes by running the following command: `git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict\"`.\n\n6. Push the changes: Push the changes to your new branch by running the following command: `git push origin new-branch-name`.\n\n7.

You will rate the quality of the output on multiple aspects such as Helpfulness, Clarity, Factuality, Depth, and Engagement.\n\n## Query: \nProvide instructions for the given exercise.\n\nLeg Raises\n \n## Output:\nLeg raises are a great exercise for strengthening your lower abs and hip flexors. Here are the instructions:\n\n1. Lie flat on your back on a mat or the floor with your arms at your sides and your legs straight out in front of you.\n2. Slowly lift your legs off the ground, keeping them straight and together. Your feet should be pointed towards the ceiling.\n3. Continue lifting your legs until they are perpendicular to the ground or as high as you can comfortably go.\n4. Hold this position for a few seconds, then slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.\n5. Repeat for 10-15 repetitions, or as many as you can comfortably do.\n\nTips:\n- Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to protect your lower back.\n- If you find it difficult to keep your legs straight, you can bend your knees slightly.\n- To make the exercise more challenging, you can add ankle weights or hold a medicine ball between your feet.\n\n\n## Evaluate\n\n### Aspects \n\n- Helpfulness: Rate the response based on how well it addresses the user's query and provides a relevant solution. A score of 5 indicates the answer fully aids the user, while a 1 suggests it offers little to no help.\n\n- Clarity: Rate the response based on how well-structured it is, with ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner. A high score of 5 means the answer is clear and logically structured, while a 1 suggests a disjointed or confusing reply.  \n\n- Factuality: Evaluate the factual accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided. A perfect 5 indicates the information is entirely correct and accurate, while a 1 suggests it has significant factual errors.\n\n- Depth: Determine the level of detail and thoroughness in the response. A score of 5 means the answer delves deeply into the topic, while a 1 indicates it barely scratches the surface.\n\n- Engagement: Assess how engaging and natural the response sounds in a conversational context.

Syntax: Python has a more straightforward and readable syntax, while JavaScript has a more complex syntax with more punctuation and braces.\n\n2. Type of language: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime.

Execution environment: Python is typically used for server-side programming, while JavaScript is used for client-side programming in web browsers.\n\n4. Libraries and frameworks: Python has a wide range of libraries and frameworks for various purposes, including data analysis, machine learning, and web development. JavaScript has a large number of libraries and frameworks for web development, including React, Angular, and Vue.\n\n5. Performance: Python is generally slower than JavaScript, especially when it comes to web development. However, Python is faster when it comes to data analysis and scientific computing.\n\n6. Debugging: Python has a more robust debugging environment than JavaScript, with tools like pdb and PyCharm. JavaScript has debugging tools like Chrome DevTools and Firebug.\n\nOverall, Python and JavaScript are both powerful programming languages with their own strengths and weaknesses.

Performance: Python is generally slower than JavaScript, especially when it comes to web development. However, Python is faster when it comes to data analysis and scientific computing.\n\n6. Debugging: Python has a more robust debugging environment than JavaScript, with tools like pdb and PyCharm. JavaScript has debugging tools like Chrome DevTools and Firebug.\n\nOverall, Python and JavaScript are both powerful programming languages with their own strengths and weaknesses. The choice of language depends on the specific requirements of the project and the preferences of the developer.\n\n\n## Evaluate\n\n### Aspects \n\n- Helpfulness: Rate the response based on how well it addresses the user's query and provides a relevant solution. A score of 5 indicates the answer fully aids the user, while a 1 suggests it offers little to no help.\n\n- Clarity: Rate the response based on how well-structured it is, with ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner. A high score of 5 means the answer is clear and logically structured, while a 1 suggests a disjointed or confusing reply.  \n\n- Factuality: Evaluate the factual accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided. A perfect 5 indicates the information is entirely correct and accurate, while a 1 suggests it has significant factual errors.\n\n- Depth: Determine the level of detail and thoroughness in the response. A score of 5 means the answer delves deeply into the topic, while a 1 indicates it barely scratches the surface.\n\n- Engagement: Assess how engaging and natural the response sounds in a conversational context. A high score of 5 reflects a response that feels engaging and human-like in its tone, while a 1 indicates a robotic or boring reply.\n\n### Format \n\nGiven the query, please rate the quality of the output by scoring it from 1 to 5 individually on **each aspect**. \n\n- 1: strongly disagree \n- 2: disagree \n- 3: neutral\n- 4: agree\n- 5: strongly agree\n\nNow, please output your scores and a short rationale below in a json format by filling in the placeholders in []:\n```\n{\n    \"helpfulness\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"factuality\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"depth\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"engagement\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    }\n}\n```\n",
