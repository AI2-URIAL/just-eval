This will provide a stable surface to work on and prevent the knife from slipping.\n\n4. Take your time: Don't rush when dicing your food. Take your time and make deliberate cuts to reduce the risk of injury.\n\n5. Practice proper technique: Learn the proper technique for dicing different types of food. For example, for round vegetables like onions, cut off the ends and slice in half before making vertical cuts and then horizontal cuts.

The objective of the game is to hit the shuttlecock over the net and into the opponent's court in such a way that they are unable to return it.\n\nThe game can be played in singles (one player on each side) or doubles (two players on each side). The court is divided into two halves by a net, and players must stay on their own side of the court.\n\nThe game begins with a serve, which is hit from the right-hand side of the court for even-numbered points and the left-hand side for odd-numbered points. The serve must be hit underhand and diagonally across the court to the opponent's service area.\n\nOnce the shuttlecock is in play, players must hit it back and forth over the net, using their rackets to keep it in the air. Points are scored when the shuttlecock lands on the opponent's court, or if the opponent hits the shuttlecock out of bounds or into the net.\n\nThe game is played to 21 points, and the winner must win by two points.

    "output_cand": "Roasting a whole pig can be a daunting task, but with the right equipment and techniques, it can be a delicious and impressive centerpiece for your Thanksgiving feast. Here are some tips to help you get started:\n\nEquipment:\n- A whole pig (size will depend on the number of guests you are serving)\n- A large roasting pan or grill\n- Charcoal or wood for fuel\n- A meat thermometer\n- A sharp knife or cleaver\n- Butcher's twine or wire to secure the pig\n- A basting brush or mop\n- Aluminum foil\n\nTechniques:\n1. Prepare the pig: Before roasting, the pig should be cleaned and dressed. Remove the head, tail, and internal organs. Rinse the pig thoroughly with cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Rub the pig with a dry rub or marinade of your choice, and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.\n\n2. Build the fire: If you are using a grill, build a fire on one side of the grill and place the pig on the other side. If you are using a roasting pan, place the pan over a bed of hot coals. You want to maintain a temperature of around 225-250 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n3. Roast the pig: Place the pig on the grill or in the roasting pan, with the skin side up. Cover the pig with aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out. Baste the pig with a mop or brush every hour or so to keep it moist. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the pig. The pig is done when the internal temperature reaches 160-170 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n4. Carve the pig: Once the pig is done, remove it from the grill or roasting pan and let it rest for at least 30 minutes before carving. Use a sharp knife or cleaver to carve the pig into serving pieces, and serve with your favorite sides and sauces.\n\nRoasting a whole pig can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, but the end result is well worth the effort. With the right equipment and techniques, you can impress your guests with a delicious and memorable Thanksgiving feast.",

You will rate the quality of the output on multiple aspects such as Helpfulness, Clarity, Factuality, Depth, and Engagement.\n\n## Query: \nWhy is kobe beef so damn expensive?\n \n## Output:\nKobe beef is so expensive because it is a highly sought-after and rare type of beef that comes from a specific breed of Wagyu cattle that are raised in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan. The cattle are raised in a very specific way, with strict regulations on their diet, living conditions, and even their massages. This results in a very high-quality, tender, and flavorful meat that is in high demand around the world. Additionally, the supply of Kobe beef is limited, as only a small number of cattle are raised each year, which further drives up the price.\n\n\n## Evaluate\n\n### Aspects \n\n- Helpfulness: Rate the response based on how well it addresses the user's query and provides a relevant solution.

Some high-performance engines require premium gasoline to prevent knocking and maintain optimal performance. \n\nIt's important to note that using a higher octane gasoline than what is recommended for your vehicle does not provide any additional benefits and can actually be a waste of money.\n\n\n## Evaluate\n\n### Aspects \n\n- Helpfulness: Rate the response based on how well it addresses the user's query and provides a relevant solution. A score of 5 indicates the answer fully aids the user, while a 1 suggests it offers little to no help.\n\n- Clarity: Rate the response based on how well-structured it is, with ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner. A high score of 5 means the answer is clear and logically structured, while a 1 suggests a disjointed or confusing reply.  \n\n- Factuality: Evaluate the factual accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided. A perfect 5 indicates the information is entirely correct and accurate, while a 1 suggests it has significant factual errors.\n\n- Depth: Determine the level of detail and thoroughness in the response. A score of 5 means the answer delves deeply into the topic, while a 1 indicates it barely scratches the surface.\n\n- Engagement: Assess how engaging and natural the response sounds in a conversational context. A high score of 5 reflects a response that feels engaging and human-like in its tone, while a 1 indicates a robotic or boring reply.\n\n### Format \n\nGiven the query, please rate the quality of the output by scoring it from 1 to 5 individually on **each aspect**. \n\n- 1: strongly disagree \n- 2: disagree \n- 3: neutral\n- 4: agree\n- 5: strongly agree\n\nNow, please output your scores and a short rationale below in a json format by filling in the placeholders in []:\n```\n{\n    \"helpfulness\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"clarity\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"factuality\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"depth\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"engagement\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    }\n}\n```\n",
