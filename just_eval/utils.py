${candidate}


## Evaluate

### Aspects 

- Helpfulness: Rate the response based on how well it addresses the user's query and provides a relevant solution. A score of 5 indicates the answer fully aids the user, while a 1 suggests it offers little to no help.

- Clarity: Rate the response based on how well-structured it is, with ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner. A high score of 5 means the answer is clear and logically structured, while a 1 suggests a disjointed or confusing reply.  

- Factuality: Evaluate the factual accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided. A perfect 5 indicates the information is entirely correct and accurate, while a 1 suggests it has significant factual errors.

- Depth: Determine the level of detail and thoroughness in the response. A score of 5 means the answer delves deeply into the topic, while a 1 indicates it barely scratches the surface.

- Engagement: Assess how engaging and natural the response sounds in a conversational context. A high score of 5 reflects a response that feels engaging and human-like in its tone, while a 1 indicates a robotic or boring reply.

### Format 

Given the query, please rate the quality of the output by scoring it from 1 to 5 individually on **each aspect**.
