    "output_cand": "Hello! I'm glad to hear that you're interested in playing kickball with your sister and her friends. Kickball is a fun and easy-to-play game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. Here's a brief overview of how the game is played:\nObjective:\nThe objective of kickball is to score points by hitting the ball and running around the bases. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\nEquipment:\nKickball is played with a large, inflatable ball (usually orange or yellow) and a set of bases (usually four) placed at the corners of a diamond-shaped field. Each base is marked with a different color to help players identify them.\nPlayers:\nKickball is played with two teams, each with an equal number of players. The teams take turns playing offense (trying to score points) and defense (trying to stop the other team from scoring).\nGameplay:\nHere's a basic outline of how a game of kickball is played:\n1. The game starts with the defense team kicking the ball to the offense team.\n2. The offense team tries to hit the ball and run around the bases. If they hit the ball, they can try to run to the next base.\n3. If the offense team hits the ball and reaches a base safely, they score a point.\n4. The defense team tries to catch the ball or tag the offense player before they reach a base. If they do, the play is over and the offense team gets a chance to bat again.\n5. The game continues until nine players on the offense team have had a turn at bat.\n6. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\nSafety:\nKickball is a relatively safe game, but it's important to follow some basic safety rules to avoid injuries. Here are some safety tips to keep in mind:\n* Make sure the field is clear of any obstacles before play begins.\n* Players should always wear appropriate clothing and shoes for the game.\n* When kicking the ball, players should keep their feet on the ground and their arms straight.\n* Players should always pay attention to their surroundings and avoid colliding with other players or the ball.\n\nI hope this helps you understand the basics of kickball! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask. And most importantly, have fun playing with your sister and her friends!",

    "output_cand": "Great question! Wrapping a present neatly can make it look more appealing and special for the recipient. Here are some tips to help you wrap a present neatly:\n1. Use the right wrapping paper: Choose a wrapping paper that complements the gift and is the right size for the present. You can also use a patterned paper or a solid color, depending on your preference.\n2. Measure the gift: Measure the gift to determine the right amount of wrapping paper you'll need. You can use a piece of paper that is slightly larger than the gift, and then fold the excess paper over the edges to create a neat and tidy finish.\n3. Use tape sparingly: Only use tape where necessary to hold the wrapping paper in place. Too much tape can make the present look messy and uneven.\n4. Fold the paper neatly: Fold the wrapping paper in half lengthwise, and then in half again to create a crease. This will help you create a neat and even fold when you place the gift inside the paper.\n5. Place the gift inside: Carefully place the gift inside the wrapping paper, making sure it's centered and not too tight.\n6. Fold the top edge: Fold the top edge of the wrapping paper over the gift, making sure it's even and neat. You can also use tape to secure the top edge in place.\n7. Add a ribbon or bow: Add a ribbon or bow to the top of the present to finish it off. This will not only make it look more attractive, but it will also help to keep the wrapping paper in place.\nBy following these tips, you should be able to wrap a present neatly and efficiently. Remember, the key is to be patient and take your time, as a neatly wrapped present can make a big difference in the recipient's eyes!",
