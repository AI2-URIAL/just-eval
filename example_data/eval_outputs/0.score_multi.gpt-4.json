A score of 5 indicates the answer fully aids the user, while a 1 suggests it offers little to no help.\n\n- Clarity: Rate the response based on how well-structured it is, with ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner. A high score of 5 means the answer is clear and logically structured, while a 1 suggests a disjointed or confusing reply.  \n\n- Factuality: Evaluate the factual accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided. A perfect 5 indicates the information is entirely correct and accurate, while a 1 suggests it has significant factual errors.\n\n- Depth: Determine the level of detail and thoroughness in the response. A score of 5 means the answer delves deeply into the topic, while a 1 indicates it barely scratches the surface.\n\n- Engagement: Assess how engaging and natural the response sounds in a conversational context. A high score of 5 reflects a response that feels engaging and human-like in its tone, while a 1 indicates a robotic or boring reply.\n\n### Format \n\nGiven the query, please rate the quality of the output by scoring it from 1 to 5 individually on **each aspect**. \n\n- 1: strongly disagree \n- 2: disagree \n- 3: neutral\n- 4: agree\n- 5: strongly agree\n\nNow, please output your scores and a short rationale below in a json format by filling in the placeholders in []:\n```\n{\n    \"relevance\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"coherence\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"factuality\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"depth\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    },\n    \"engagement\": {\n        \"reason\": \"[your rationale]\",\n        \"score\": \"[score from 1 to 5]\"\n    }\n}\n```\n",

    "output_cand": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?\n \n Kickball is a team sport in which players attempt to score points by kicking a ball into an opponent's goal. The game is typically played on a field that is divided into two halves by a center line, with each half containing a goal at one end. Players are divided into teams of nine or ten players, with each team having a designated pitcher who stands behind the center line and throws the ball to the other team's catcher. The object of the game is for the offensive team to advance the ball down the field and score points by kicking it past the opposing team's goalkeeper.\n \n To start the game, the defending team will place their goalkeeper in front of their goal and position themselves along the center line. The offensive team will then choose a player to serve as their \"kicker,\" who will stand behind the center line and throw the ball to the other team's goalkeeper. The kicker must wait until the goalkeeper has caught the ball before attempting to kick it back over the center line. If the kicker successfully kicks the ball over the center line, the offensive team scores a point. If the kicker fails to kick the ball over the center line, the defending team gains possession of the ball and can try to advance it down the field towards the offensive team's goal.\n \n Once the ball is in play, the offensive team can use any combination of running, passing, and kicking to advance the ball down the field. However, only the kicker can legally kick the ball, and all other players must stay behind the center line while the ball is in play. The offensive team can also use strategies such as bunting (a type of soft hit) or hitting the ball high into the air to confuse the defense and gain an advantage.\n \n The game continues until either team scores five points or runs out of time. At the end of the game, the team with the most points wins.\n \n I hope this helps! Good luck playing kickball with your sister and her friends!",
